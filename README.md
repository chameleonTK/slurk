Slurk - A Lightweight Chat Server for Dialogue Experiments and Data Collection
==============================================================================

Slurk (think "slack for mechanical turk"...) is a lightweight and easily extensible chat server built especially for
conducting multimodal dialogue experiments or data collections. See [Slurk: Whatâ€™s this?][what's this] for a description
of the main concepts. Or jump right in with the [Getting Started][] Guide!

The main idea of Slurk is to have a platform that can be used without any change to the Slurk Server
by creating task-specific bots. The bots can create rooms, custom chat layouts, and control
the distribution of users to rooms. In the following architecture overview, the main
components of Slurk are outlined.

![Slurk architecture][architecture]

Slurk is built in Python 3.9, on top of [Flask] and [Flask-SocketIO].

To run slurk, the simplest way is to use docker

```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80 -e SLURK_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:////slurk.db slurk/server
admin token:
01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
```

Now you can open `localhost` in your browser and log in with any username and the provided admin token


The [full documentation][doc] can be found on GitHUb.

Happy slurking!
